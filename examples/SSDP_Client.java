 * SSDP_client is a class that is meant to be used to discover and retrieve data from the simple service discovery protocol that runs on top of the rest api server
 * it uses multicast sockets and the SSDP protocl (one step in the UPNP protocl) to announce its looking for servers and subsequently waits for and stores the responses to pass back to the caller
 * see: https://openconnectivity.org/upnp-specs/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v2.0-20200417.pdf for an overview of the SSDp protocol
